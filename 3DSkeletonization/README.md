# README

This projet in intended to develop a Dual Skeletonization algorithm by using VTK PolyData as basic data structure.


## Directories  
* Code : C++ implementation of the current algorithm.
* Article : Code related to the research article describing the technical solution.
* Data : contains the data objets (meshes in format ply) used to test the algorithm.

## Code
The algorithm is developped in C++ with Cmake to handle the compilation and the linking to necessary libraries.
The algorithm needs a compilation of the [VTK 7.0 library](https://www.vtk.org).
